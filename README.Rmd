The coronavirus package provides a formated irregular time series dataset of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) epidemic. The raw data pulled from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CCSE) Coronavirus [repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).

## Installation

You can install the released version of coronavirus from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("coronavirus")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("RamiKrispin/coronavirus")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(coronavirus)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
